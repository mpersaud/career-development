### What is it? 

Impostor syndrome (also known as impostor phenomenon or fraud syndrome or the impostor experience) is a concept describing individuals who are marked by an inability to internalize their accomplishments and a persistent fear of being exposed as a "fraud".

* Making a list of accomplishments, positive feedback and success stories will also aid to manage impostor syndrome

## Explanatory Styles

Consider two people, Mike and Ike, who both apply for a job at Vandelay Industries. Both are rejected.

##### Mike is a pessimist. He assumes, rightly or wrongly, that the reason he missed out is 

* personal (I wasn’t good enough)

* and/or permanent (I’ll never get ahead)

* and/or pervasive (this ruins everything -what’s the point of living).

With this explanatory style Mike is at risk of giving up on himself, is less likely to try again and is also more vulnerable to depression.

##### In contrast, Ben is an optimist. Faced with the identical setback he assumes the cause is 

* non-personal (the best canidate got it)

* and temporary (I had a hangover that day)

* and non-pervasive (this impacted this job, but not my relationship, my hobbies, my friends, my job search, my gym membership etc -life goes on).
