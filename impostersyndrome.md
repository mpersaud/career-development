### What is it? 

Impostor syndrome (also known as impostor phenomenon or fraud syndrome or the impostor experience) is a concept describing individuals who are marked by an inability to internalize their accomplishments and a persistent fear of being exposed as a "fraud".

## Explanatory Styles

Consider two people, Mike and Ike, who both apply for a job at Vandelay Industries. Both are rejected.

##### Mike is a pessimist. He assumes, rightly or wrongly, that the reason he missed out is 

* personal (I wasn’t good enough)

* and/or permanent (I’ll never get ahead)

* and/or pervasive (this ruins everything -what’s the point of living).

With this explanatory style Mike is at risk of giving up on himself, is less likely to try again and is also more vulnerable to depression.

##### In contrast, Ben is an optimist. Faced with the identical setback he assumes the cause is 

* non-personal (the best canidate got it)

* and temporary (I had a hangover that day)

* and non-pervasive (this impacted this job, but not my relationship, my hobbies, my friends, my job search, my gym membership etc -life goes on). 

#### Steps to overcome imposter syndrome
1) Recognize that it exsist

2) When you receive positive feedback, embrace it with objectivity and internalize it. By denying it, you are hurting that person’s judgement.

3) Don’t attribute your successes to luck.

4) Don’t talk about your abilities or successes with words like “merely,” “only,” “simply,” etc.

5) Keep a journal. Writing your successes and failures down gives you a retrospective insight about them, and re-reading them makes you remember equally both of them.

6) Recognize that the perfect performer doesn’t exist, and that problems will pop up eventually. Take them as little fires under you that make you move forward.

7) Be proud of being humble.

8) Remember that it’s okay to seek help from others, and that even the best do it.
