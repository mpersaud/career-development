## What To Do When You Make A Mistake?

When you recognize you have made a mistake and your performance is less than you would like, your next, critical, step is to address the issue - no judgment or criticism.

Train yourself to look at situations and experiences with an open mind. Instead of berating yourself for messing 'IT' up, try to accept what you have done (or not done) and ask yourself "What am I going to do differently next time?" This doesn't mean that you ignore your faults or problems, but that you focus on improving them and getting better results.

## Explanatory Styles

Consider two people, Mike and Ike, who both apply for a job at Vandelay Industries. Both are rejected.

##### Mike is a pessimist. He assumes, rightly or wrongly, that the reason he missed out is 

* personal (I wasn’t good enough)

* and/or permanent (I’ll never get ahead)

* and/or pervasive (this ruins everything -what’s the point of living).

With this explanatory style Mike is at risk of giving up on himself, is less likely to try again and is also more vulnerable to depression.

##### In contrast, Ike is an optimist. Faced with the identical setback he assumes the cause is 

* non-personal (the best canidate got it)

* and temporary (I had a hangover that day)

* and non-pervasive (this impacted this job, but not my relationship, my hobbies, my friends, my job search, my gym membership etc -life goes on).

#### Optimism vs Pessimism A Real Life Example
How 2 Team Leaders Handled the Same Productivity Improvement Challenge

Several years ago, I worked with two Team Leaders from opposite shifts. And two very different ways of thinking, you are unlikely to come across! Talk about optimism vs pessimism - these guys were almost polar opposites.
There was a drive within the plant, to improve productivity by around 30%, and at the same time to decrease scrap rates by about 12%.
The Pessimist's response: "This is impossible, can't be done, why should we even try to achieve such ridiculous targets?" The Optimistic Team Leader's response "Hmm, going to be tough to get, but let's see what we can do". Talk about a classic optimism vs pessimism response!
Within about six months, the Optimist's team had taken significant strides toward achieving both goals, and they were talking about how they were going to celebrate when they did reach the targets. The Pessimist's team had made some improvements, but only minimal, morale had slipped even further, and they were accusing the optimist's team of all sorts of under-hand behavior. The Pessimist Team Leader had become very defensive about why his team hadn't achieved similar results.
I was asked to work closely with the Pessimistic Team Leader, to see if I could help him to achieve the targets. Because of his world-view - "things don't go well/it's all too hard etc". I decided the only area I would work on with him, was to help him to shift to a more Optimistic view point - technically he knew all he needed, to help his team to make the improvements the business wanted.
Each day, I would challenge him to look for the things that were going right, and reward himself and his team, I asked him to be aware of how he was responding to new ideas/challenges, and to start to look for reasons why something might work, rather than why it wouldn't work, and shouldn't bother trying.
The shift was slow, but as he became more focused on looking for the opportunities vs the obstacles, his behavior changed, and as his behavior changed so too did his, (and his team's), results.
One of the turning points for him, was when I shared with him information about how to control his self-talk so that it led him more to the thinking patterns of success, than of 'give-up-itis'!

#### Steps to overcome imposter syndrome
1) Recognize that it exsist

2) When you receive positive feedback, embrace it with objectivity and internalize it. By denying it, you are hurting that person’s judgement.

3) Don’t attribute your successes to luck.

4) Don’t talk about your abilities or successes with words like “merely,” “only,” “simply,” etc.

5) Keep a journal. Writing your successes and failures down gives you a retrospective insight about them, and re-reading them makes you remember equally both of them.

6) Recognize that the perfect performer doesn’t exist, and that problems will pop up eventually. Take them as little fires under you that make you move forward.

7) Be proud of being humble.

8) Remember that it’s okay to seek help from others, and that even the best do it.
