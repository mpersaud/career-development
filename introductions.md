## Introductions
As we covered in our last session. The art of netowrking has changed over time so the we need adapt to change. There are two different types of outreach we will focus on.

Before we begin, let's discuss 

* How can we re-engage with current connections? What and where can we use as speaking points?
* Be comfortable with rejection (not all outreach will be successful)

## LinkedIn Introductions (Warm/Cold Outreach)
#### What may be a benefit to being introduced by a mutual connection?
#### In what situation (if any) would you prefer reaching out directly to a 2nd degree connection over an introduction?

There are different ways of getting introduced on LinkedIn. You can click <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/116/different-ways-of-getting-introduced-on-linkedin?lang=en">here</a> to see the steps on asking for an introduction

###### Let's review yesterday's session and see if we have any 2nd degree connections we would like an introduction for.

* Personalize it to the individual you’re reaching out to. 

Sending a stock message like ‘I’d like to connect with you on LinkedIn’ is impersonal. It also doesn’t share your reasons for reaching out, which in turn doesn’t help the person who you want to connect to see how they can help you. As a result, they may just reject you because they don’t have an open network and don’t like connecting to people who are irrelevant to them. If they’re a warm contact, always say how they know you in the invitation in case they’ve forgotten.

* State your purpose for contacting this person.

Though you might not have space to go in-depth into this during your initial invitation to connect, emphasizing it when you message them for the first time is key. A major mistake I see a lot of my connections making is when they send me an outreach letter and it’s clear that they want to talk to me but I don’t know what it’s about, how I can help them, or why they’re reaching out to me specifically. This leads me to think that meeting with them could be a waste of both of our times. Instead, be very specific about what you’d like from them. If it’s an introduction to another professional in their network, don’t dance around the subject. The same goes for an informational interview. If you want to talk to them, tell them what you’d like to hear their opinion on.

* Make sure that your request is easy for them to say yes to.

This means making sure that you’ve thought ahead and accommodated them for everything you could think of. If you’re reaching out to a senior professional, chances are they’re extremely busy and won’t be inclined to accept an ‘informational interview’ at an unknown location for an unknown duration. Instead, explicitly state that you’re seeking 15 minutes of their time at their convenience either in person, over the phone, or over video. Then, when they agree, provide them with an agenda that details exactly what you’d like to achieve. The more transparent you are, the easier it will be for others to want to help you.


### Let's review some samples of introduction request based on the relationship with the connection
