## LinkedIn and Building Your Connections
### What is it? 
LinkedIn is a business and employment-oriented social networking service

### How to Network on LinkedIn
##### 100% complete = 40x more opportunities
Building connections starts with people seeing all you have to offer. Members with complete profiles are 40x more likely to receive opportunities through LinkedIn.

##### You’re more experienced than you think
Think broadly about all your experience, including summer jobs, unpaid internships, volunteer work, and student organizations. You never know what might catch someone’s eye.

##### Use your inbox
Networking doesn’t mean reaching out cold to strangers. Start building your LinkedIn network by uploading your online address book (from your email account) and connecting to people you know and trust.

##### Get personal
As you build your connections, customize your requests with a friendly note and, if necessary, a reminder of where you met, who you met through, or what organization you have in common.

##### Join the “In” crowd
LinkedIn Groups can help you form new connections. Start with your school groups and reach out to alumni. Find volunteer organizations and associations you belong to. Also look for group associated with your skills/professional interest

##### Lend a (virtual) hand
As you build connections, think about how you can support others. Comment on a classmate’s status update or forward a job listing to a friend – your generosity will be returned!

##### Request informational interviews
Don’t ask professional contacts for a job. Instead, ask for a brief phone conversation to seek their job search advice. Alumni, family friends, and industry leaders are often willing to do so.

##### Do your homework
Before an informational interview, a formal interview, or a networking
event, use LinkedIn’s Advanced Search and Company Pages to learn about the background and interests of the people you’re meeting. 

##### Step away from the computer
Support your online networking with a real human touch. Set up calls,
attend live events, and send snail mail notes to people you interact
with on LinkedIn.

## Let's Talk Quality vs Quantity

#####Questions to discuss as a group

* Do we know how many connections we have and where to locate them?
* Where have our connection came from? School, Work, Personal Friends, etc.
* Are we accepting all request?
* Do we follow up when receiving a request or customize our request?
* Do we respond to InMail/Messages from recruiters?

Most professionals of the younger generation may have been lectured by  seasoned professionals about how the art of networking has changed over the years.

######"You have Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn- back in my day we had to work hard to network! You should have better connections than anyone!"

#####How has networking in your opinion, changed over the years?

People in todays generation have grown up with social media outlets, and therefore have “friends”, “followers” and “connections” dating back for a good portion of our lives. So we have become accustomed to quantity.

######"We don’t see hand-writen thank you notes, cold-call prospective employers."

Everything is available online at our fingertips. Which is good and bad. The problem is the (im)balance between quality and quantity.
We have even mastered the art of sending a request to “connect” with someone on LinkedIn. Yet as skillful as we may be, the fact is ANYONE else can do this, and most people are. So we all have hundreds of contacts. However, developing a quality connection is more difficult than ever.

Applying for a job or making a connection with someone is done with the click of a button... rather impersonal. Even when you do connect with someone, chances are dozens of other people just like you are trying to do the same. Inboxes are flooded, people are forgotten. Congratulations on your 500+ connections! How many of them do you know on a personal level?

The likes of Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and social media in general have caused a shift in the perception that quantity is now somehow superior to quality.

### Why Seek Connection/Introduction?

* When you are applying for a new job. It might increase the likelihood for your resume to be read if you have a warm introduction via a connection at the company.

* If you are seeking advice or insight on a company or an industry where you don't have much experience. If you don't have knowledge, find someone who does, through someone you know.
